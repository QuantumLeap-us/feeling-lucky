## Project Description
This project involves creating a frame for Warpcast, a platform for interactive applications within Farcaster posts. The frame is designed to be deployed using Vercel for serverless functions and Github for version control and collaboration.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Github account
- The Vercel CLI installed
- A local copy of the frame code

## Deployment Instructions

### Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run `git clone [repository URL]`.

### Set Up Github Repository
1. Create a new repository on Github.
2. Copy the repository URL.

### Connect Local Repository to Github
1. Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine.
2. Run `git remote add origin [repository URL]` and `git push -u origin master`.

### Deploy to Vercel
1. Sign up for a Vercel account if you don't have one.
2. Install the Vercel CLI with `npm install -g vercel`.
3. In the project directory, run `vercel` to deploy.
4. Follow the prompts to set up your Vercel project.

### Testing with Vercel Dev
1. Install the Vercel CLI if not already installed.
2. In the project directory, run `vercel dev` to start the local server.
3. Open your browser and navigate to the local URL to test.

## Conclusion
You have now successfully deployed your frame from your local machine to Github and Vercel, and tested it using Vercel dev. For any questions or issues, refer to the documentation or contact support.

Happy coding!
