# Feeling Lucky - Warpcast Frame Deployment Guide

## Overview
"Feeling Lucky" is a Warpcast frame that delivers a dose of humor with a simple click. Designed for those who appreciate a good laugh, it fetches a random joke, blending traditional dad jokes with a touch of adult humor, while steering clear of sensitive topics. This project is a testament to the collaborative power of AI and creativity, tailored for artists and creators diving into the world of coding.

### Features
- Random Joke Generation: Delivers a mix of one-part and two-part jokes.
- Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across all devices.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy navigation with a single "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.
